# IgnitionSwagger
This is an implementation of Version 2 of the Open API Specification Standard (aka Swagger) using only Ignition WebDev and Scripting resources.

## Status
This is a work in progress. It is currently in a **early Alpha** state.

## Remaining Work To Do
- [ ] Fully implement mock `Pet Store` endpoints.
- [ ] Document how to call the `test` endpoints.
- [ ] Provide export of Postman requests for easier testing.
- [ ] Flesh out `README` at repository root level, explaining how to safely set up an Ignition project with these resources.
- [ ] Flesh out `README` Script Resource in Ignition, explaining how to create new endpoints.
- [ ] Document where to find "Project Variables" that can be changed, and what they can be safely changed to.
